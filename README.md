## Setting up a MERN project for your Captone Projects

1. clone this repo into the name your would want to use for your project
2. move into that folder in your terminal
3. start a new react application and call it frontend
4. Go and get your MONGODB URLs (production URL and development URL)
5. Start working

##### Code snippet of above instruction (for getting the project on your computer)
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/kali-physi-hacker/captsone-project-template.git [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]
code .
```


##### What next
1. create a .env file and add the contents (More details in the video)
2. run `npm install` inside your terminal in the backend folder
3. outside backend folder but in your project folder, run `npx create-react-app frontend`. (That is going to be your frontend folder)
